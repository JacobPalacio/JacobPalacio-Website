        <div class="subheading mb-5">Instructional Design</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a 3rd Year Undergraduate student at UCR, with a current GPA of 3.61. I plan to graduate in 2021 with a Bachelor’s Degree in Theatre, Film, and Digital Production. I’ve been writing stories ever since I was a kid, and I knew from a very young age that making movies was exactly what I wanted to do. When I was in elementary school, I had a lot of trouble fitting in and making friends, and there weren’t a whole lot of people that were interested in the same things as me. I remember the year Guillermo Del Toro’s film Pan’s Labyrinth came out. I saw a DVD copy of it when I was shopping at Borders one day, and the creatures on the front cover immediately caught my eye. I convinced my grandma to buy it for me, and watched it as soon as I got home; and that’s when my life pretty much changed forever. That film introduced me to cinema as I know and understand it today; it is not only a medium that is used for the sake of entertainment, but it can be used in so many other ways. Film can be used to convey certain emotions, it can be used to make various statements that resonate with others, it can be used to open up minds to newer ideas, and it can be used as a way to tell a story that puts the audience into a world like nothing else could. <br><br>

        It can perhaps even change one’s life, and that’s exactly what Pan’s Labyrinth did to me. It changed my life. My goal as a filmmaker is to make films like Pan’s Labyrinth; it is to make a film that maybe one day somebody can look up to, and be completely affected by. Movies were there for me when nobody else was, and the fact that this medium had that much of an effect on me is incredibly inspiring. Because of my love for film, I have now been introduced to some amazing people, and I now have some amazing friends, who are all on the same path as me. Movies helped me to not feel so alone.
<br><br>

        My time here at UCR, as well as being surrounded by these people who have been with me and supported me throughout the years, has helped me get closer in making that dream come true. Being a part of this program would not only be a great new path for my future, but it would also help me get one step closer to reaching my life long goals as a filmmaker. Since I have gotten older, I’ve garnered a lot more knowledge in terms of how filmmaking works, thanks to the films I’ve watched and the wonderful people who have always been there for me. I would love to put this sustained knowledge and effort into my future work, and I feel as if making more connections would help my flourishing knowledge and creative drive grow stronger than ever.
